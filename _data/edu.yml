    1) Adding HVAC control system and VFD for the air handlers, adjusting the frequency of fan to meet to         
market temperature requirement, 2) Installing lighting control system, it enables to turn on/off lighting depends on 
different regions and schedules. 3) Some stores also installed the chiller plant control system, it makes the chiller operate 
safely and efficiently. 
  Responsibility on the project: 1) Cooperating with sub-contractor to install different sensors and instruct wire connection of controllers, debugging and commissioning the BMS system. 
2) Training the operator of stores about how to use Building Management System.
